# Orbital Utility Vehicle :: Change Log

* 2016-0505: 1.1.1 (nli2work) for KSP 1.1.2
	+ maintenance update for KSP 1.1.2
	+ adjustment for some dragCubes
	+ Config and Texture adjustments for KIS/KAS and JSIAdvTransparentPod
* 2016-0424: 1.1 (nli2work) for KSP 1.1
	+ maintenance update for KSP 1.1
	+ Adjusted Service Bay for more space.
	+ Firespitter no longer required. Texture and fuel switch with ModuleManager.
	+ Some additional surface attach area for Adaptor/Carrier
* 2016-0329: 1.0.9.1 (nli2work) for KSP 1.0.5
	+ Fixed some collider issues, for carrier adaptor, where you can become stuck on Size 1 Docking Port after grabbing with perfect alignment.
	+ Added visual indicator for the carrier adaptor, and orientation switcher (for when you use it with Drone or Command Pod). Red=Left; Green=Right; Yellow=Up.
* 2016-0328: 1.0.9 (nli2work) for KSP 1.0.5
	+ Grabber Core reduced SAS to 20; Increased max RCS power to 15 w/ default RCS power at 5%
	+ Helper Drones, remote drones with integrated RCS to help maneuver large objects. Max RCS power 8; default power at 10%.
	+ Adaptor Carrier, transitional part, Forward grabber unit, carriage compartment for up to 4 Helper Drones, 160 Mono capacity. Adjusted RCS thruster locations reduce torque while translating with RCS.
	+ Added indicator for engine reverse thrust  mode.
	+ Foward Adaptor, with service bay, will be phased out in another update or two.
* 2016-0315: 1.0.8 (nli2work) for KSP 1.0.5

	+ Fixed Command pod KAS variant, nose winch now ejects correctly without being blocked.
	+ Lowered Push Adaptor's RCS thrust to 3.
	+ Nuclear Engine now fueled by LF or Mono.
