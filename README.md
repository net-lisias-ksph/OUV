**Command Pod**, roughly same size as Mk1; Looking for an IVA Has data transmitter built-in. Two variants depending on other active mods.

       * KAS: adds front mounted winch unit w 30 meter cable.
       * SCANSat: adds small SCANSat network uplink unit w/ BTDT scanner and MapTraq modules.
       * FStextureSwitch2 for some visual customization options

**Advanced Drone Unit**, derived from the Command Pod. Crew space converted to service bay. More EC and Mono capacity. Integrated RCS thrusters. One variant available

       * RemoteTech: Service bay removed. Adds 500km passive Omni antenna and 9Mm directional antenna, should allow comfortable operation within Kerbin SOI. Increased EC and Mono capacity. Integral RTG will prevent complete loss of control from lack of EC; but will require periodic recharge with additional power sources.
       * FStextureSwitch2 for some visual customization options

**Grappler unit**, very handy for moving things around when you don't have a docking port. Moderate EC capacity and LF/OX or Mono fuel options. Modular Fuel Tank configs via MM * FStextureSwitch2 for some visual customization options

**Radial NV engine**, burns LF or Mono. Reversible thrust. Full extension to around 2m, a tad shorter than the FT400 fuel tank. can give you that extra clearance you need when hauling large objects. Keep Kerbals away from moving parts. Fixed reverse thrust. added thrust Gimbal. KSPI-E Config included

**Carrier Adaptor**, Grabber Unit with carrying capacity for up to 4 Helper Drones.

**Push Adaptor**, retained for the time being. Service bay instead of docking bays for for Helper Drones.

**Helper Drone**, Remote controlled RCS block with integrated Light and RTG. Max RCS Power 8, default set to 10%. Use grabber for docking after initial separation (decoupler). 3km Omni antenna when used with Remote Tech.

**Grappler Jr.** Service Bay w/ Grappler Arm w/ External Command seat.
